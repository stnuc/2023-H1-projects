Foo PT by [ideagalaxy](https://github.com/ideagalaxy)  

<br>

__Purpose of Service__  
Disadvantage of existing service
- Hassle of finding and recording a diet
- Teach only how to exercise, no feedback on posture
- Must record the number of exercise times & sets self
- No diet-exercise-management apps are available or poor

To improving these disadvantages, plan to make Foo PT application  

__Service Implementation__
- Initial part: Setting Goal & current state, then provide dietary and exercise management using bigdata  
- Dietary part: Recognizing food using YOLOv5  
Taking a picture of meal you ate, measuring and recording the type, calories, and amount of food  
Implement measure the type and calories of food  
- Exercising part: Computing angle between pin-points with MediaPipe, detecting right posture, and counting  
Dumbelkul counting, failure, posture feedback via voice

[Facedetect Drone](https://github.com/stnuc/Facedetect_Drone) by [ideagalaxy](https://github.com/ideagalaxy)  

<br>

Recently, many text messages have been sent to find missing people through the safety disaster text system  
Between 2021 and 2023, there were about 2,500 missing person search texts sent, of which 700 were resolved through text reports, showing about 27% of the results  
However, as many as 10 disaster messages are sent a day, many people easily ignore disaster messages such as typhoons and earthquakes, or feel tired from repeated alarms  
Drones have the advantage of fast search speed and economic search for a wide range  
If the advantages of these drones are utilized to search for missing persons, there is a possibility that disaster characters can be replaced  
Therefore, the goal of this project is to implement the function of searching for missing persons using drones and check the possibility of use  

__Functions__
- Control Drone
    - Control panel with flask website  
    - With Tello (Drone) that supports control via python socket connection  
    - Real-time video streaming
- Face Recognition
    - Real-time face recognition with Haar Cascade: Considering real-time advantages in performance, even if the accuracy is low
    - dlib: identifying missing person compare with snapshot via drone, dlib provides HOG features and CNN, this uses HOG feature

<br>

__Limitation__
- Hardware: Drone has only 10 minutes of use
- Accuracy: Face recognition performance with HOG feature is noot good enough
